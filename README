class:
Fractal:
    an father fractal that represent an fractal
    i chosed to make it a  pure virtual class because there is no use in a abstract Fractal
    also the ctor of the Class is protected so only the children will be allowed to access/
    the class is implementing: the pure vir method drewF that prints out the fractal accordingly to the
    Fractal shape and look , i choosed not to implement it an abstract way so we will be able to add
    more Fractal in the future, and also pure virtual class.
    this class also holds an virtual Dtor  for all of the classes
    the methode Is marked is a bool method that return True if we need to print # in a current index or ' 'otherwise
    it is implemented with in the Fractal class due to the fact that the implantation for the two first fractals (Ss,SCarpet)
    was the same with one change in the size factor. the CantorD class will override it .
Ss:
    a Fractal that inherits form Fractal implement it own drewF and rule of 5 operators will use
    the same  isMarked method with size factor of 2
SCarpet:
    a Fractal that inherits form Fractal implement it own drewF and rule of 5 operators will use
      the same  isMarked method with size factor of 3
CantorD:
    a Fractal that inherits form Fractal implement it own drewF and rule of 5 operators will use
    the same  different drew F method becouse it have a different inside logic and the lack to add more
    unnecessary parameters to the function

FractalDrawer:
    a cpp with a main that read the file using the fsteam and create the needed Fractals and push them into a
    stl stack , while reading the file we Exit and print an Invalid mess if the lines are on illegal format
    also will print ,mess if there is an memory error or fstream exp or any anther.
    after it will create the needed Fractals , the program will pop the Fractals from the stack and prints them
    out to consol according to each Fractal drewF method that take care of the Fractal shape and dim as needed.
